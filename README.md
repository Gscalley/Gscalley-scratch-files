<p>Chapter 1:<p>
<p>1.	What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold. = ‘debug”  everything that’s on the bug lists<p>

<p>2.	What is “Bugzilla?” = a program used to compile the lists of bugs in a system and how long they’ll take to complete<p>

<p>3.	What is OSAF? = Open Source Applications Foundation <p>

<p>4.	What is the projects name? = chandler<p>

<p>5.	What will the software do? = Be a personal information manager (PIM) for organizing and sharing calendars, emails, to-do lists, etc.<p>

<p>6.	What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs? = “scary”<p>

<p>7.	What scared Toy so much about Bug 44? = the fact that they couldn’t estimate how long it would take to fix<p>

<p>8.	What did Toy refer to as a “snake?” = “important problem that we don’t have consensus on how to attack”<p>

<p>9.	In the software world, what does “slippage” mean? = lateness<p>

<p>10.	Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?
11.	What is Brooks's Law? = IBM system/360, his law was “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later”<p>

<p>12.	Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code? = 1/6 or 16.6%<p>

<p>13.	Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs? = 50%<p>

<p>14.	Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions? = when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them<p>

<p>15.	What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer? = source code allows anyone to access its inner workings<p>

<p>16.	What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share? = that software that anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time<p>

<p>17.	What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer? = good ones know how to write, great ones know how to rewrite<p>

<p>18.	Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them. = open source software  vs.  private software not accessible to everyone<p>

<p>19.	Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns? = it just shows that having software open source can have benefits<p>

<p>What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled? = that developers should stop designing and start coding</p>

<p>Chapter 2:<p>
<p>1.	What was the lifetime as a supported product, of Lotus 123? When did Kapor walk away from it? Why did he walk away from it? = he left when the company in 1986 had grown exponentially, with thousands of employees making millions of dollars a year.<p> 

<p>2.	What does it mean for a program to “fork?” = to respond to technical disagreements by splitting into rival camps<p>

<p>3.	Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain. = he says that software is like witchcraft in that it like someone has a small secret and is guarding it, and how that has died out in the software world.<p>

<p>4.	Who, where, when demonstrated one of the first PIM software programs? = Douglas Engelbart, in 1968 introduced the world to the idea of a link and a mouse, along with other elements of personal computing<p>

<p>5.	People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term? = builders of early computer systems had borrowed the term from the concept of pulling one’s self up by the bootstraps to describe the paradox of getting a computer up and running.<p>

<p>6.	Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed? = at xerox’s palo alto research center<p>

<p>7.	List three software project “train wrecks.” = the attempt to upgrade IRS systems abandoned in the 70s by Pres. Carter, second attempt canceled by congress in 95’, abd the recent effort suffering massive delays and cost over-runs.<p>

<p>8.	What software crisis? Scan this article, what does it suggest? 
http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-non-existent-software-crisis-debunki/240165910 = Since 1995, the Standish Group has reported rather abysmal statistics — from a rate of roughly one-in-six projects succeeding in 1995 to roughly one-in-three projects today, but this author suggests that there is no crisis,<p> 


<p>9.	Scan down this article to the two conclusions (about eight paragraphs down). With two sentences, what is your take away from this?
http://scribblethink.org/Work/Softestim/softestim.html
